**Official Open Source Bot**

---

*Due to the new Scrum-System, the Management Board of Berlin is now announcing the new Open-Source Community Bot Programm.*

**How does it work?**
> For suggesting a new feature you have to create a pull request and choose a the category file that fits the best with your suggestion. After that the pull request will be reviewed by a contributer. If the suggestion is good, it will be created by a contributer and uploaded to the **Berlin, Deutschland - Beta Bot**. If there are no bugs, the new feature will be published to the final bot and then, every user is able to use it.

**What should I do if I find a bug?**
> If you find a bug you have to create a pull request and choose a category file that fits the best with your bug. The bug will be reviewed by a contributer and will be fixed after a few days.
